        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            We aim to connect the good residents of The Shire 
            to the businesses here in the shire. This means we 
            are here to help those who need services and goods 
            and those who provide services and goods.
        </p>

            <h3>The Bartender</h3>
            <img src="images/bartender.webp" alt="Headshot of the bartender">
            <p>
                The bartender is one who has heard a great many things. He wears out his days
                serving those who come into his pub, and cleaning up after their large messes.
                Here he can connect with those who provide the ale, or advertise to others that
                he has the finest drinks in the shire.

            <img src="images/hobbit.webp" alt="A picture of a hobbit">
            <p>
                A simple hobbit who lives within his means among the good folk of the shire. 
                He lives a simple life, and gardening is his hobby. His friend is the adoptive
                child or nephew (its not really clear) of a famous hobbit who ventured out of
                the shire on a grand adventure with some dwarfs and a mysterious man. He is a
                gardener and loves his job. Here he can find the best provider for his pipeweed
                or find the best foods for his wedding.

            <h3>The Traveler</h3>
            <img src="images/traveler.webp" alt="A picture of a traveler">
            <p>
                A wise and powerful, and mysterious travler from a far off land. 
                He has many contacts among the nations of middle earth and beyond. 
                He may seek to free peoples from an oppressive evil being who is years 
                old and raising an army, or he may seek after the demise of a 
                dragon which lives in a mountain. Regardless, he is on the search for 
                a single person, or a group of small people who are just right for 
                whatever task he may require of them to complete. Here he can find 
                the right candidate for an exiting adventure.

            <h3>The Dwarf</h3>
            <img src="images/dwarf.webp" alt="A picture of a dwarf">
            <p>
                Far from home and always looking for a good drink and a great time, 
                here the dwarf could find the finest brew available, a place to 
                stay for the night, and a provider for the necessary rations to 
                travel.
